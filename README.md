# Arena: Fantasy Combat Simulator
Arena is a work in progress roguelike/simulation game. It's currently a skeleton devoid of content but contains the base of an entity and tile system, a fine grain time management system, and data structures for material simulation. It's built for python 3.10 and requires asciimatics for rendering until a proper SDL solution is built.
